Parallel Coordinates
====================

.. hint:: 

   Conveys a dense overview of the trial objectives in a multi-dimensional space.
   Helps identifying trends of best or worst hyperparameter values.

The parallel coordinates plot decomposes a search space of `n` dimensions into `n`
axis so that the entire space can be visualized simultaneously. Each dimension
is represented as a vertical axis and trials are represented as lines crossing each 
axis at the corresponding value of the hyperparameters. There is no obvious optimal ordering
for the vertical axis, and you will often find that changing the order helps better understanding
the data. Additionally, the lines are plotted with graded colors based on the objective. The
gradation is shown in a color bar on the right of the plot. Note that the objectives are added
as the last axis is the plot as well.

The parallel coordinates plot can be executed directly from the ``experiment`` with
``plot.parallel_coordinates()`` as shown in the example below.

# In this basic example the parallel coordinates plot is marginally useful as there are only
# 2 dimensions. It is possible however to identify the best performing values of ``dropout`` and
# ``learning_rate``. The GIF below demonstrates how to select subsets of the
# axis to highlight the trials that corresponds to the best objectives.

# Lets now load the results from tutorial
# :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_tutorials_code_2_hyperband_checkpoint.py` for an example with a larger search
# space.

# Load the data for the specified experiment

# As you can see, the large number of trials until trained for a few epochs is cluttering the entire
# plot. You can first select the trials with 120 epochs to clear the plot. Once that is done,
# We can see that gamma and momentum had limited influence. Good trials can be found
# for almost any values of gamma and momentum. On the other hand, learning rate
# and weight decay are clearly more optimal in lower values. You can try re-ordering the columns as
# shown in the animation below to see the connections between one hyperparameter and the objective.

# Special cases
# -------------
#
# Logarithmic scale
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# .. note::
#
#     Logarithmic scales are not supported yet. Contributions are welcome. :)
#     See `issue <https://github.com/Epistimio/orion/issues/555>`_.
#
# Dimension with shape
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# If some dimensions have a :ref:`search-space-shape` larger than 1, they will be flattened so that
# each subdimension can be represented in the parallel coordinates plot.

# Load the data for the specified experiment
experiment = get_experiment("2-dim-shape-exp", storage=storage)
fig = experiment.plot.parallel_coordinates()
fig

#%%
# In the example above, the dimension ``learning_rate~loguniform(1e-5, 1e-2, shape=3)``
# is flattened and represented with ``learning_rate[i]``. If the shape would be or more dimensions
# (ex: ``(3, 2)``), the indices would be ``learning_rate[i,j]`` with i=0..2 and j=0..1.

#%%
# The flattened hyperparameters can be fully selected with ``params=['<name>']``.
#

experiment.plot.parallel_coordinates(order=["/learning_rate"])

#%%
# Or a subset of the flattened hyperparameters can be selected with ``params=['<name>[index]']``.
#

experiment.plot.parallel_coordinates(order=["/learning_rate[0]", "/learning_rate[1]"])


#%%
# Categorical dimension
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Parallel coordinates plots can also render categorical dimensions, in which case the
# categories are shown in an arbitrary order on the axis.

# Load the data for the specified experiment
experiment = get_experiment("3-dim-cat-shape-exp", storage=storage)
fig = experiment.plot.parallel_coordinates()

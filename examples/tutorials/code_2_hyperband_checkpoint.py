Checkpointing trials
====================

.. hint::

    In short, you should use "{experiment.working_dir}/{trial.hash_params}" to set the path of
    the checkpointing file.

When using multi-fidelity algorithms such as Hyperband it is preferable to checkpoint the trials
to avoid starting training from scratch when resuming a trial. In this tutorial for instance,
hyperband will train VGG11 for 1 epoch, pick the best candidates and train them for 7 more epochs,
doing the same again for 30 epoch, and then 120 epochs. We want to resume training at last epoch
instead of starting from scratch.

Oríon provides a unique hash for trials that can be used to define the unique checkpoint file
path: ``trial.hash_params``. This can be used with the Python API as demonstrated in this example
or with :ref:`commandline_templates`.

With command line
-----------------

The example below is based on the Python API solely. It is also possible to do checkpointing
using the command line API. To this end, your script should accept an argument for the checkpoint
file path. Suppose this argument is ``--checkpoint``, you should call your script with the
following template.

::

    orion hunt -n <exp name>
        ./your_script.sh --checkpoint '{experiment.working_dir}/{trial.hash_params}'

Your script is responsible to take this checkpoint path, resume from checkpoints or same
checkpoints.
We will demonstrate below how this can be done with PyTorch, but using Oríon's Python API.

Training code
-------------

We will first go through the training code piece by piece before tackling the hyperparameter
optimization.

First things first, the imports.

# Moving the cursor over the points, we see that only a handful of trials
# lead to better results with 1 epoch. Otherwise, all other trials with validation error rate
# below 80% were trained for more than 1 epoch.
# The best found result is high, a validation accuracy 23.6%. With VGG11 we could expect to achieve
# lower than 10%. To see if the search space may be the issue, we first look at the
# :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_plot_3_lpi.py`.

# The momentum and weight decay had very large priors, yet the different values
# had no important effect on the validation accuracy. We can ignore them.
# For the learning rate and for gamma
# it is worth looking at the :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_plot_4_partial_dependencies.py`

# The main culprit for the high validation error rate seems to be the wide prior for ``gamma``.
# Because of this Hyperband spent most of the computation time on bad ``gamma``s. This prior
# should be narrowed to ``uniform(0.995, 1)``.
# The prior for the learning rate could also be narrowed to ``loguniform(0.001, 0.1)`` to
# help the optimization.
#
# Note that Hyperband could also find better results without adjusting the search space, but
# it would required significantly more repetitions.

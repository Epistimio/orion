Examples
========

In this folder, you will find the source code used in the examples from the
[documentation](https://orion.readthedocs.io/en/develop/index.html). The scripts are ready to be
used with Oríon right-away. Use them as inspiration for your projects or copy them directly into
your development environment!

Each folder corresponds to one example. Feel free to add some of your own!

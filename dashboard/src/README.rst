This code provides a common Orion dashboard to display experiments and benchmarks.

Orion Dashboard is heavily based on
`Carbon's React Tutorial <https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/developing/react-tutorial/overview>`_.

===========================
Oríon Dashboard (Prototype)
===========================

Orion Dashboard for experiments
-------------------------------

This is a very preliminary prototype of a dashboard for Oríon. Most of it are
just place-holders and static data to show visualizations.

===============================
Dashboard for Oríon's Benchmark
===============================

Oríon's `benchmark <https://orion.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/benchmark.html>`_ makes it easy
to execute multiple hyperparameter optimization algorithms on several tasks. You can
assess the average result over multiple runs of the algorithms or automatically benchmark
how well they parallelize to large pools of workers. It quickly becomes difficult however to
analyse all the data generated by these benchmarks, as large number of tasks and assessments can lead to
hundreds of potential plots. It can also be challenging to track the progress of hundreds of experiments,
each consisting of hundreds of trials. This dashboard serves as a centralized interface to visualize
the results of the benchmarks and to monitor their progress.

=============
Installations
=============

This dashboard uses React and Carbon. You will need to install npm first, and then yarn.

.. code-block:: console

   npm insall --global yarn

Install all dependencies including Carbon.

.. code-block:: console

   yarn

Host
----

You can start the server with

.. code-block:: console

   yarn start

The first time will take a few minutes while everything gets compiled. Next time will be faster.

It's worth to take a look at the :doc:`configuration system <user/config>` to learn more about how
to make the most out of Or√≠on and define precise behaviors for your algorithms and experiments.

Explore the :doc:`User Manual </user/overview>`, orion is simple from the outside but is feature
rich! If you're a researcher or develop you might be interested to :doc:`contribute
</developer/overview>` or develop your own :doc:`algorithms plugins </plugins/base>`!

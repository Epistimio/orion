Similarly to search spaces, Oríon supports multiple algorithms out of the box: :ref:`random-search`,
:ref:`ASHA`, and :ref:`hyperband-algorithm`. Each one is fully configurable through the
configuration file. The samples of hyperparameter are based on the previous trials.

for an quick overview of each algorithm and to visit :doc:´/user/algorithms´ to learn about the
algorithms and get recommendations about their use cases.

It's worth to take a look at the :doc:`configuration system <user/config>` to learn more about how
to make the most out of Oríon and define precise behaviors for your algorithms and experiments.

Explore the :doc:`User Manual </user/overview>`, orion is simple from the outside but is feature
rich! If you're a researcher or develop you might be interested to :doc:`contribute
</developer/overview>` or develop your own :doc:`algorithms plugins </plugins/base>`!

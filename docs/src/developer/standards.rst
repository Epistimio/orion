Coding and Repository Standards
===============================

We are using flake8_ (along with some of its plugins) and pylint_.
Their styles are provided in ``/tox.ini`` and ``/.pylintrc`` respectively.

.. code-block:: sh

   tox -e flake8
   tox -e pylint

Also, we are using a check-manifest_ which compares ``/MANIFEST.in`` and git
structure of the source repository, and finally readme_renderer_ which
checks whether ``/README.rst`` can be
actually rendered in PyPI_ website page for Oríon.

.. code-block:: sh

   tox -e packaging

To run all of expected linters execute::

   tox -e lint

.. _flake8: http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/
.. _pylint: https://www.pylint.org/
.. _check-manifest: https://pypi.org/project/check-manifest/
.. _readme_renderer: https://pypi.org/project/readme_renderer/
.. _PyPI: https://pypi.org/

   :synopsis: Experiment nodes connecting experiments to the EVC tree

The experiments are connected to one another through the experiment nodes. The former can be created
standalone without an EVC tree. When connected to an `ExperimentNode`, the experiments gain access
to trials of other experiments by using method `ExperimentNode.fetch_trials`.

Helper functions are provided to fetch trials keeping the tree structure. Those can be helpful when
analyzing an EVC tree.

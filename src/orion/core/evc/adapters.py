"""
Adapters to connect experiments within the EVC system
=====================================================

Experiment branches because of changes in the configuration or the user's code. This make
experiments incompatible with one another unless we define adapters such that a branched experiment
B can access trials from parent experiment A.

Adapters have two main methods, forward and backward. The method forward defines how trials from
parent experiment A are filtered or adapted to be compatible with experiment B. Modifications are
only applied at execution time and are not saved anywhere in the database. Adapters only provides a
view on an experiment.

There is adapters for

    * Dimension addition
    * Dimension deletion
    * Dimension renaming
    * Change of dimension prior
    * Change of algorithm
    * Change of code
    * Combining different adapters

Adapters all have a `to_dict` method which provides sufficient information to rebuild the adapter.
This is to facilitate save of adapters in a database and retrieval.

Adapters can be build using the factory class `Adapter(**kwargs)` or using
`Adapter.build(list_of_dicts)`.

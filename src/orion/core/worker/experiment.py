    Attributes
    ----------
    name : str
       Unique identifier for this experiment per `user`.
    id: object
       id of the experiment in the database if experiment is configured. Value is `None`
       if the experiment is not configured.
    refers : dict or list of `Experiment` objects, after initialization is done.
       A dictionary pointing to a past `Experiment` id, ``refers[parent_id]``, whose
       trials we want to add in the history of completed trials we want to re-use.
       For convenience and database effiency purpose, all experiments of a common tree shares
       `refers[root_id]`, with the root experiment refering to itself.
    version: int
        Current version of this experiment.
    metadata : dict
       Contains managerial information about this `Experiment`.
    pool_size : int
       How many workers can participate asynchronously in this `Experiment`.
    max_trials : int
       How many trials must be evaluated, before considering this `Experiment` done.
       This attribute can be updated if the rest of the experiment configuration
       is the same. In that case, if trying to set to an already set experiment,
       it will overwrite the previous one.
    space: Space
       Object representing the optimization space.
    algorithms : `PrimaryAlgo` object.
       Complete specification of the optimization and dynamical procedures taking
       place in this `Experiment`.

    Metadata
    --------
    user : str
       System user currently owning this running process, the one who invoked **Oríon**.
    datetime : `datetime.datetime`
       When was this particular configuration submitted to the database.
    orion_version : str
       Version of **Oríon** which suggested this experiment. `user`'s current
       **Oríon** version.
    user_script : str
       Full absolute path to `user`'s executable.
    user_args : list of str
       Contains separate arguments to be passed when invoking `user_script`,
       possibly templated for **Oríon**.
    user_vcs : str, optional
       User's version control system for this executable's code repository.
    user_version : str, optional
       Current user's repository version.
    user_commit_hash : str, optional
       Current `Experiment`'s commit hash for **Oríon**'s invocation.

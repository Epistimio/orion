Configuration is different and generates a branching event:

Hint
----

This error is typically caused by the following 2 reasons:
  1) Commandline calls where arguments are different from one worker to another
     (think of paths that are worker specific). There will be --cli-change-type
     in the error message above if it is the case.
  2) User script that writes to the repository of the script, causing changes in the code
     and therefore leading to branching events. There will be --code-change-type
     in the error message above if it is the case.

For each case you should:
  1) Use --non-monitored-arguments [ARGUMENT_NAME]
     (where you argument would be --argument-name, note the lack of dashes at
      the beginning and the underscores instead of dashes between words)
     The commandline argument only support one entry. To ignore many arguments,
     you can use the option in a local config file, or in the global config file:
     ```
     evc:
         non_monitored_arguments: ['FIRST_ARG', 'ANOTHER_ARG']
     ```

  2) Avoid writing data in your repository. It should only be code anyway, right? :)
     Otherwise, you can ignore code changes altogether with option --ignore-code-changes.

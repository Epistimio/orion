DESCRIPTION = """
Command to delete experiments and trials.

To delete an experiment and its trials, simply give the experiment's name.
$ orion db rm my-exp-name

To delete only trials that are broken, simply add --status broken.
Note that the experiment will not be deleted, only the trials.
$ orion db rm my-exp-name --status broken

Or --status * to delete all trials of the experiment.
$ orion db rm my-exp-name --status *

By default, the last version of the experiment is deleted. Add --version
to select a prior version. Note that all child of the selected version
will be deleted as well. You cannot delete a parent experiment without
deleting the child experiments.

Base Search Algorithm
=====================

Formulation of a general search algorithm with respect to some objective.
Algorithm implementations must inherit from `orion.algo.base.BaseAlgorithm`.

Algorithms can be created using `algo_factory.create()`.

Examples
--------
>>> algo_factory.create('random', space, seed=1)
>>> algo_factory.create('some_fancy_algo', space, **some_fancy_algo_config)

class BaseAlgorithm:
    """Base class describing what an algorithm can do.

    Parameters
    ----------
    space : `orion.algo.space.Space`
       Definition of a problem's parameter space.
    kwargs : dict
       Tunable elements of a particular algorithm, a dictionary from
       hyperparameter names to values.

    Notes
    -----
    We are using the No Free Lunch theorem's [1]_[3]_ formulation of an
    `BaseAlgorithm`.
    We treat it as a part of a procedure which in each iteration suggests a
    sample of the parameter space of the problem as a candidate solution and observes
    the results of its evaluation.

    **Developer Note**: Each algorithm's complete specification, i.e.  implementation of its methods
    and parameters of its own, lies in a separate concrete algorithm class, which must be an
    **immediate** subclass of `BaseAlgorithm`. [The reason for this is current implementation of
    `orion.core.utils.Factory` metaclass which uses `BaseAlgorithm.__subclasses__()`.] Second, one
    must declare an algorithm's own parameters (tunable elements which could be set by
    configuration). This is done by passing them to `BaseAlgorithm.__init__()` by calling Python's
    super with a `Space` object as a positional argument plus algorithm's own parameters as keyword
    arguments. The keys of the keyword arguments passed to `BaseAlgorithm.__init__()` are interpreted
    as the algorithm's parameter names. So for example, a subclass could be as simple as this
    (regarding the logistics, not an actual algorithm's implementation):

    Examples

           def suggest(self, num=1):
               print(self.another_param)
               return list(map(lambda x: tuple(map(lambda y: self.multiplier * y, x)),
                               self.space.sample(num)))

       s = Space()
       s.register(dim)

Exploit classes for Population Based Training
---------------------------------------------

Formulation of a general exploit function for population based training.
Implementations must inherit from ``orion.algo.pbt.BaseExploit``.

Exploit objects can be created using `exploit_factory.create()`.

Examples
--------
>>> exploit_factory.create('TruncateExploit')
>>> exploit_factory.create('TruncateExploit', min_forking_population=10)

    The exploit class is responsible for deciding whether the Population Based Training algorithm

    This class is expected to be stateless and serve as a configurable callable object.

        The method receives the current trial under examination and all lineages of
        population based training. It must then decide whether the trial should be promoted
        (continue with a higher fidelity) or if another trial should be forked instead.


        Parameters
        ----------
        rng: numpy.random.Generator
            A random number generator. It is not contained in ``BaseExploit`` because the exploit

    Backtracking Exploit

    This exploit is inspired from PBT with backtracking proposed in [1].
    Instead of using all trials at the same level of fidelity as in
    ``TruncateExploit``, it selects
    the best trials from each lineage (worker), one per lineage. The objective of the
    best trial is compared to the objective of the trial under analysis, and if the ratio
    is higher than some threshold the current trial is not promoted. A trial from the pool
    of best trials is selected randomly.

    The backtracking threshold
    defined by [1] is unstable however and cause division error by 0 when the best candidate trial
    has an objective of 0. Also, if we select trials at any fidelity levels, we would
    likely drop any trial at a low fidelity in favor of best trials at high fidelity.
    This class use a quantile threshold instead of the ratio in [1] to determine if a trial should
    be continued at next fidelity level. The candidates for forking are select from
    best trials from all running lineages (workers), like proposed in [1], but limited to trials
    up to the fidelity level of the current trial under analysis.

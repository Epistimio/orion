class PBT(BaseAlgorithm):
    """Population Based Training algorithm

    Warning:PBT is broken in current version v0.2.4. We are working on a fix to be released in
    v0.2.5, ETA July 2022.

    Population based training is an evolutionary algorithm that evolve trials
    from low fidelity levels to high fidelity levels (ex: number of epochs).
    For a population of size `m`, it first samples `m` trials at lowest fidelity level.
    When trials are completed, it decides based on the ``exploit`` configuration whether
    the trial should be promoted to next fidelity level or whether another trial
    should be selected instead and forked. When a trial is forked, new hyperparameters are
    selected based on the trials hyperparameters and the ``explore`` configuration.
    The original trial's working_dir is then copied over to the new trial's working_dir
    so that the user script can resume execution from model parameters of original trial.

    It is important that the weights of models trained for each trial are saved in the corresponding
    directory at path ``trial.working_dir``. The file name does not matter. The entire directory is
    copied to a new ``trial.working_dir`` when PBT selects a good model and explore new
    hyperparameters. The new trial can be resumed by the user by loading the weights found in the
    freshly copied ``new_trial.working_dir``, and saved back at the same path at end of trial
    execution. To access ``trial.working_dir`` from Oríon's commandline API, see documentation at
    https://orion.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/script.html#command-line-templating. To access
    ``trial.working_dir`` from Oríon's Python API, set argument ``trial_arg="trial"`` when executing
    method :py:meth:`orion.client.experiment.ExperimentClient.workon`.

    The number of fidelity levels is determined by the argument ``generations``. The lowest
    and highest fidelity levels, and the distrubition, is determined by the search space's
    dimension that will have a prior ``fidelity(low, high, base)``, where ``base`` is the
    logarithm base of the dimension. Original PBT algorithm uses a base of 1.

    PBT will try to return as many trials as possible when calling ``suggest(num)``, up to ``num``.
    When ``population_size`` trials are sampled and more trials are requested, it will try to
    generate new trials by promoting or forking existing trials in a queue. This queue will get
    filled when calling ``observe(trials)`` on completed or broken trials.

    If trials are broken at lowest fidelity level, they are ignored and will not count
    in population size so that PBT can sample additional trials to reach ``population_size``
    completed trials at lowest fidelity. If a trial is broken at higher fidelity, the
    original trial leading to the broken trial is examined again for ``exploit`` and ``explore``.
    If the broken trial was the result of a fork, then we backtrack to the trial that was dropped
    during ``exploit`` in favor of the forked trial. If the broken trial was a promotion, then
    we backtrack to the original trial that was promoted.

    For more information on the algorithm,
    see original paper at https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09846.

    Notes
    -----
    It is important that the experiment using this algorithm has a working directory properly
    set. The experiment's working dir serve as the base for the trial's working directories.

    The trial's working directory is ``trial.working_dir``. This is where the weights of the model
    should be saved. Using ``trial.hash_params`` to determine a unique working dir for the trial
    will result in working on a different directory than the one copied by PBT, hence missing the
    copied model parameters.

    Parameters
    ----------
    space: `orion.algo.space.Space`
        Optimisation space with priors for each dimension.
    seed: None, int or sequence of int
        Seed for the random number generator used to sample new trials.
        Default: ``None``
    population_size: int, optional
        Size of the population. No trial will be continued until there are `population_size`
        trials executed until lowest fidelity. If a trial is broken during execution at lowest
        fidelity, the algorithm will sample a new trial, keeping the population of *non-broken*
        trials at `population_size`.  For efficiency it is better to have less workers running than
        population_size. Default: 50.
    generations: int, optional
        Number of generations, from lowest fidelity to highest one. This will determine how
        many branchings occur during the execution of PBT. Default: 10
    exploit: dict or None, optional
        Configuration for a ``pbt.exploit.BaseExploit`` object that determines
        when if a trial should be exploited or not. If None, default configuration
        is a ``PipelineExploit`` with ``BacktrackExploit`` and ``TruncateExploit``.
    explore: dict or None, optional
        Configuration for a ``pbt.explore.BaseExplore`` object that returns new parameter
        values for exploited trials. If None, default configuration is a ``PipelineExplore`` with
        ``ResampleExplore`` and ``PerturbExplore``.
    fork_timeout: int, optional
        Maximum amount of time in seconds that an attempt to mutate a trial should take, otherwise
        algorithm.suggest() will raise ``SuggestionTimeout``. Default: 60

    the new trials crashed and required rollback) and the forked trial will refer to the
    dropped one with ``base`` (it can only refer one).

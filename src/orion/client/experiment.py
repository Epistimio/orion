        Parameters
        ----------
        fct: callable
            Function to optimize. Must take arguments provided by trial.params. Additional constant
            parameter can be passed as ``**kwargs`` to `workon`. Function must return the final
            objective.
        n_workers: int, optional
            Number of workers to run in parallel. Defaults to value of global config.
        max_trials: int, optional
            Maximum number of trials to execute within ``workon``. If the experiment or algorithm
            reach status is_done before, the execution of ``workon`` terminates.
            Defaults to experiment's max trial. If ``max_trials`` is larger than
            ``experiment.max_trials``, the experiment will stop when reaching
            ``experiment.max_trials``.
        max_trials_per_worker: int, optional
            Maximum number of trials to execute within each worker. ``max_trials`` and
            ``experiment.max_trials`` have precedence. Defaults to global config.
        max_broken: int, optional
            Maximum number of broken trials to accept during `workon`. When this threshold is
            reached the function will raise :class:`orion.core.utils.exceptions.BrokenExperiment`.
            Defaults to value of global config.
        trial_arg: str, optional
            The function ``fct`` may support receiving the trial as an argument. This argument name
            can be specified with ``trial_arg``. If not defined (``None``), then only the
            hyperparameters will be passed to `fct`.
        on_error: callable, optional
            Callback that is executed if an error occur during the execution of ``fct``.
            The signature of the callback must be
            ``foo(ExperimentClient, Trial, Error, nb_of_worker_broken_trials)``.
            If the callblack returns False, the error will be ignored, otherwise it is counted
            for the threshold `max_broken`. In case of critical errors, you may also directly
            raise an error and force break out of ``workon``.
        **kwargs
            Constant argument to pass to `fct` in addition to trial.params. If values in kwargs are
            present in trial.params, the latter takes precedence.

        Raises
        ------
        :class:`orion.core.utils.exceptions.InvalidResult`
             If results returned by `fct` have invalid format.

        :class:`orion.core.utils.exceptions.WaitingForTrials`
            if the experiment is not completed and algorithm needs to wait for some
            trials to complete before it can suggest new trials.

        :class:`orion.core.utils.exceptions.BrokenExperiment`
            if too many trials failed to run and the experiment cannot continue.
            This is determined by ``max_broken`` in the configuration of the experiment.

        :class:`orion.core.utils.exceptions.SampleTimeout`
            if the algorithm of the experiment could not sample new unique points.

        :class:`orion.core.utils.exceptions.UnsupportedOperation`
            If the experiment was not loaded in executable mode.

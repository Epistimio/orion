Generic Storage Protocol
========================

Implement a generic protocol to allow Orion to communicate using different storage backend.

Storage protocol is a generic way of allowing Orion to interface with different storage.
MongoDB, track, cometML, MLFLow, etc...

Examples
--------
>>> storage_factory.create('track', uri='file://orion_test.json')
>>> storage_factory.create('legacy', experiment=...)

Notes
-----
When retrieving an already initialized Storage object you should use `get_storage`.
`storage_factory.create()` should only be used for initialization purposes as `get_storage`
raises more granular error messages.
